### Outline 
1. We aim to map weather events throughout the United States over a period of time, most likely the past 20 years. We will use data from NOAA to map the paths of tornados and include other information such as damage, magnitude, length, and cost. We will also include other graphics such as descriptions, charts, and other supporting information. 

### Proposal
1. Persona/ Scenario 
    1. Persona 
    The target user is a person working in a weather related fields such as meteorologist, scientists, storm chasers, and other interested parties. People included in this list may want to learn more about past weather events and patterns to help them predict future ones. 

User Scenarios 

Scenario #1:  

The user is tasked with determining where to allocate public safety resources for future tornadoes. To do this, they want to examine the severity and injuries. The user arrives at the interactive and wants to use data from the last five years, so they set the years to include the last five on the slider. From the dropdown menu, the user selects to compare by magnitude. They opt to deselect EF0 because they are not interested in tornadoes that cause minor damage, as well as EF5 their rarity, considering them outliers. The user proceeds to filter through the magnitude scale, deselecting options as they identify where the most severe tornadoes occur. The interactive gives them the idea of where most severe tornadoes take place and their path. Next, the user wants to see the magnitude and location/ paths that result in the most injuries. The user selects injuries from the dropdown menu and compares the paths of the ones that result in the greatest injuries based on the legend, indicating the scale.  

Scenario #2 

An employee with the National Weather Service is tasked with finding out when tornadoes are the most common to aid in preparedness. The user arrives at the interactive and sees the graph on the page that shows the number of tornadoes each month based on the years that were prepopulated. The user decides to look at data for the past twenty years, so they adjust the year scale bar to show the past twenty. The user then looks at the graph to compare the number of tornadoes that occur each month. The user then identifies the month in which the most tornadoes occur.
